# codequiz

Dynamic multiple choice quiz that includes: a timer, a way to track your score and the ability to save high scores after the quiz, when questions are answered no scrolling is required the next question will present itself

This project utilized local storage to save variables to local storage and call on them later

There is currently an issue where if the game is played multiple times only the highest score is saved to local storage and when the user goes to the score screen despite the amount of points they got on the round it will alert them that they scored the highest saved score in local storage - attemted to fix this issue by adding localStorage.clear() to the end of my function - but had no sucsess. I will update this feature at a later date
